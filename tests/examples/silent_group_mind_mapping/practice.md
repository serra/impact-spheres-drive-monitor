**Marijn**: OK, after you have addressed the remaining comments. Nothing blocking there for me.

**Dov**: OK to publish, but could be even better (see my comments) - well done :) I like the practice! 
**Paula:** OK to publish, I added two comments to think about. Definitely will be doing this one. Nice change from silent post-its and enables silent dialogue much better.

# Silent Group Mind Mapping

This is a technique that allows everyone to talk at once with no one getting interrupted! Use Silent Mind Mapping when you need to generate many ideas in just a few minutes.

You can apply this technique to validate learning that was recently acquired or to find out how much a group knows about a specific topic before exploring possibilities.

## Silent Group Mind Mapping

The goal is to capture and display a collaborative understanding of a topic in a graphical format.

It will get you:

* A shared understanding of topic and area in focus.

* A diversity of new ideas through silent, visual dialog.

This is a fun way to collaborate as it makes all participants voices equal whether or not they are extroverted or introverted.

### Prepare the exercise

Hang a large roll of paper/whiteboard or several flip-chart sheets attached together on the wall.

* Provide (dry erase) markers, ideally in a different color for each of the participants.

* Write the focus question in the center of the chart.

**Ex**: "What stood out from the last release?"

### Explain the rules by demonstrating with another person

Introduce the rules: everyone writes on the same chart, at the same time, and NO TALKING.

Show an example asking for one volunteer in the group that will demo the exercise with you as a second participant. Use a simple topic like "parts of an automobile" writing a simple word like “car” in the middle circle, and give this a go for about 30 seconds.

### Gather the group

Get the group around the board and ask them to write on it silently as many ideas as they can to answer the focus question, each one inside of a circle.

Remind everyone the session will be timeboxed and that they will have the opportunity to talk after.

### Start to silently map ideas

Get participants started on mapping ideas going with two simple recommendations: 

* As you think of something new to add to a colleague’s thought, add a circle clustered next to their circle.

* As you see responses from your colleagues, let them stimulate new ideas.

In this way as a group, continue to silently dialogue about the focus question until space is filled.

### Open the floor for clarification

Spend a few minutes with the group where they ask questions about what someone else wrote. This does not have to be a group discussion, participants can ask questions to whoever they want. This period is intended for clarification questions and answers, NOT open conversations.

Tip: If participants want to continue discussing encourage them to leave question marks on the chart for later.

### Have a final read with the group

As a group read through the clusters and mark the two or three ones that most appeal to you, that seem to have the most potential.

Take each of the appealing clusters and develop it further with questions such as:

• What other thoughts does this cluster bring to mind?

• What do you like about it?

• What is this about—what’s the central focus here?

### Capture takeaways

Take time to allow the group to capture any insights, personal notes, photos or action points they’d like to takeaway from the exercise. 

* What are you going to take with you from today?

### Ask for feedback

What did the participants think of the workshop? 

* What should we do better next time?

* How did working in silence feel?

* Which ideas from your colleagues triggered you? Why?

### Appreciate the effort

Thank everyone.
